**Indentation**

Any logically subordinate code should be indented two spaces from the line before it.

**Variables**

<var> keyword should not be used. Always use <const> for constant variables, and <let> for mutable variables.

**Strings**

Use single quotes around Javascript strings.
*Note: use double quotes for HTML attributes

**Console.logs**

Upon completion of any debugging, remove any all console.logs from your code before pushing your commits
and opening a pull request

**Pseudocode**

Before opening a pull request, make sure pseudocode has been condensed and succinct. Leave only one line
of psuedocode whenever possible.
