**Indentation**

Any logically subordinate code should be indented two spaces from the line before it.

**Variables**

Use <const> for all of your references; avoid using <var>.
If you must reassign references, use <let> instead of <var>.

**Strings**

Use single quotes around Javascript strings.
*Note: use double quotes for HTML attributes

**Console.logs**

Upon completion of any debugging, remove console.logs from your code before pushing your commits
and opening a pull request

**Pseudocode**

Before opening a pull request, make sure pseudocode has been condensed and succinct. Remove pseudocode from the planning stages of your development.

**Commits**

Commit regularly and with purpose. Start with a verb then clarify what the commit contains.
// Example commit: "Add home component bg image"

**React Bootstrap**

Import individual React Bootstrap components rather than the entire library

Good:
// import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';
Bad:
// import { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';

**Destructuring**

Use object destructuring when accessing and using multiple properties of an object. 
Use array destructuring.
